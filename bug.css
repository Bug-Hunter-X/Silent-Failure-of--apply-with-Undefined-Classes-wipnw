The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a custom directive or plugin.  If the `@apply` directive references a class that doesn't exist or is improperly defined, Tailwind won't throw a clear error. Instead, the class will simply be ignored, leading to unpredictable styling issues and making debugging difficult. This is because the error is not caught during the build process but occurs only at runtime.
